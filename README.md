# twitter-data-analysis-2023
This repo has a detailed analysis of the Twitter data.

While we might not be Twitter fans, we have to admit that it has a huge influence on the world (who doesn't know about Trump's tweets). Twitter data is not only gold in terms of insights, but <strong><em>Twitter-storms are available for analysis in near real-time</em></strong>. This means we can learn about the big waves of thoughts and moods around the world as they arise. </p>
<p>As any place filled with riches, Twitter has <em>security guards</em> blocking us from laying our hands on the data right away ⛔️ Some  authentication steps (really straightforward) are needed to call their APIs for data collection. Since our goal today is learning to extract insights from data, we have already gotten a green-pass from security ✅ Our data is ready for usage in the datasets folder — we can concentrate on the fun part! 🕵️‍♀️🌎
